There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Sub-Heading ##
  > A recommender system for the plethora of recommender systems. 

## Summary ##
  > Search for your favorite restaurants, hotels, or businesses. Retrieve all the ratings from the various crowdsourced recommendation sites (such as Yelp, Foursquare, TripAdvisor, etc.) within seconds. Find out which review site has a community that is best tailored to your tastes! 

## Problem ##
  > There are currently too many recommendation sites, and choosing between them is often an arbitrary crapshoot. Certain communities may tend to gather or develop within a certain site, which may skew the aggregated ratings.

## Solution ##
  > This web app attempts to solve the solution in two ways. (1) Retrieving all the ratings from all the recommendation sites so that the user has an awareness of a greater range of experiences, and (2) Attempt to match the user to a recommendation site that best matches her tastes by soliciting her recommendation on various businesses that she has searched for.

## Quote from You ##
  > Find a recommendation site best tailored to you.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Start by using our search bar and searching for a business of your choice to get started!

## Customer Quote ##
  > I have been using Yelp because of its popularity but little did I know that Foursquare actually best represented my tastes. I now have better recommendations for my friends when we go out for meals.
